      <p>Cornerstone is a great program especially if you have any mental disabilities and differences. They work extremely hard to 
      accomodate everyone and help them all succeed. They offer services for most of the core curriculum at WashU.
      This includes the Writing Help Desk, the Physics Help Desk, and the Calc Help Desk. These desks provide
      WashU students the opportunity to review course material and get extra help in the subjects. Each of these do not 
      require appointments in order to be helped. In addition to these services, Cornerstone also hosts a weekly physics
      help session in which students work together with an upperclassmen to solve the weekly physics problem set. 
      Futhermore, Cornerstone will assist students who need extra help by finding them a tutor to help them improve in 
      the subject they please. Cornerstone has also established study groups called of 7 to 8 students in subjects  such as chemistry and calculus.
      These study groups meet once a week to review the material from the previous week with a TA. The students lead the discussion of the topic
      and work on an additional problem set. The TA is there to steer them onto the right track in finding the correct answers, but they do not supply the answers
      to the problem. This technique allows the students to work through the material and make new connections themselves, which they
      are more likely to remember later. Cornerstone goes above and beyond to support the students of WashU academically!</p>
